    <h4>Trever Brice, Fall 21</h4>
    <h2>Assignment 1 entry:</h2>
    <p>I found this assignment pretty simple, I've made a website or two in the
      past so I didn't think I would have any trouble with it. Publishing it
      might be a little difficult, but I'll manage</p>
    <h2>Assignment 2 entry:</h2>
    <p>This assignment was much worse, I feel like putting everything in a div
    and having a dozen classes that applied to single items and no ID's was....
  poor web design. As always W3Schools and the MDN were super helpful.</p>
